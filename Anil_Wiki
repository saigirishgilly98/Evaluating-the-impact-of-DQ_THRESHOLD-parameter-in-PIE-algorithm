Week 1 : Created Wiki
Week 2:ii) Completed the task of finding the values of DQ_THRESH in various platforms:
        Linux: 16384 Bytes
          https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/sched/sch_pie.c 
          https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/net/pie.h 
        Ns3: 10000 Bytes
          https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/pie.html  
        Paper: 10000 Bytes
          https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602305  
        RFC: 16384 Bytes
          https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8033
Week 4:Uploaded network topology to github
Week 5:Read through the Documentation of Flent. Tried to modify some parameters such as tupdate and target using flent and generated its graph.
Faced issues finding the way to alter dq_threshold parameter value
   
Week 7: Downloaded iproute2 package to work on q_pie.c file to make dequeue threshold as a parameter.
Tried to modify the value of DQ_THRESH in ns-3.29 present in pie-queue-disc.cc file in ns-3.29/src/traffic-control/model
Added the latest linux kernel version (5.7.1) to proceed with altering the value of DQ_THRESH
Made appropriate changes to /include/net/pie.h and /net/sched/sch_pie.c files to include DQ_THRESH as a required parameter
Generated the kernel object files for PIE
Faced issues in building the new kernel model and installing it.
