Evaluating the impact of DQ_THRESHOLD parameter in PIE algorithm

Brief: Proportional Integral controller Enhanced (PIE) is a popular AQM algorithm deployed in
DOCSIS 3.0 modems of CableLabs, USA. In this project, the main idea is to evaluate the
impact of setting DQ_THRESHOLD on the performance of PIE algorithm.

Required experience: C, C++ and PIE
Bonus experience: Knowledge of Flent.
